It wasn’t the first time the LaRouche Political Action Committee has set up Downriver but it will be the last - at least for awhile. The group, which posts large signs of President Barack Obama with Adolf Hitler’s iconic mustache emblazened on them and hands out flyers asking for Obama’s impeachment, was told to pack it up by the Lincoln Park police after several residents complained and it was discovered that the group hadn’t pulled a permit to pass out flyers roadside.

“We’ll be back once we get this all straightened out with City Hall,” group spokesman Mike Lowery said.

Lowery was one of the two people passing out flyers to passing motorists and anyone else that stopped by the parking lot they were set up in.
Lowery said the PAC is pushing to “dump Obama,” because of his policies.

Several Downriver residents including, Allen Park resident Joe Terry, who said the display was sickening when he saw it.

“You don’t have to like my president,” he said, “but you do have to respect him. It was really upsetting to see.”

Terry said he called the police at about noon, and they were already aware of the issue.

“It made me feel good that I wasn’t the only one that called to report them,” he said. “I don’t know who these people are, but they are inciting people to riot.”

Lowery said he works with the pac because he agrees with Lyndon LaRouche’s plans to fix the country as he was handing out literature about four laws that need to be passed immediately to help fix the economy.
In recent weeks members of the PAC have been seen in the Kroger parking lot on Southfield Road in Lincoln Park, and multiple times in front of the Allen Park Post Office on Allen Road.

“We’re doing our best to get the word out,” Lowery said.
